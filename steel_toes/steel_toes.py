"""Steel Toes Kedro Hook

A hook that changes the filepath of your data based on current working git branch.

Example:

since steel_toes requires access to the project_context to work properly you will
need to use a bit of an unconventional method to initialize your hooks.

    >>> from steel_toes import SteelToes
    >>> class ProjectContext(KedroContext):
    ...    project_name = "kedro0160"
    ...    project_version = "0.16.1"
    ...    package_name = "kedro0160"
    >>> @property
    >>> def hooks(self):
    ...    self._hooks = [ SteelToes(self) ]
    ...    return self._hooks
